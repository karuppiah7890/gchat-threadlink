# GChat Permalink

An extension to add permalinks to GSuite Hangouts chat thread. 

Hangouts chat lacks the ability to link to a thread, making it difficult to refer to a particular
conversation in a room.

# Usage

## Firefox

Download from AMO - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gchat-threadlink/

## Chrome etc.

Technically, this is a webextension, which is supported across browsers. But I've not tested it on other browsers.
